## Phoenix Integration Tests

This project contains integration tests for phoenix's generated projects.

## Running tests

To install dependencies, run:

    $ mix deps.get

Then run the tests with:

    $ mix test

## How tests are written

In order to have consistent, repeatable builds, all dependencies for all phoenix
project variations are listed in `mix.exs` and locked via `mix.lock`. If a
dependency version needs to be updated, it can be updated with `mix.exs` or
using `mix deps.update <dep name>`.

It is also important to note that dependencies are initially compiled with
`MIX_ENV=test` and then copied to `_build/dev_` to improve test speed.
Therefore, dependencies should not be listed in `mix.exs` with an `only: <env>`
option.
